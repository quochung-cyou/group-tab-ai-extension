# YOUR TASK
Revise the current AI prompt to incorporate newly discovered user preferences while maintaining its core structure and effectiveness.

# CURRENT PROMPT
{currentPrompt}

# USER PREFERENCES TO INCORPORATE
{insightsJson}

# REVISION GUIDELINES

## What to Do:
1. **Preserve Structure**: Keep the existing format, sections, and instructions
2. **Add Preferences**: Integrate user preferences into relevant sections
3. **Be Specific**: Use exact domains, group names, and patterns from insights
4. **Maintain Balance**: Don't let preferences override core grouping logic
5. **Natural Integration**: Preferences should feel like part of original prompt

## Where to Add Preferences:
- In "GROUPING STRATEGY" section as additional priority rules
- In "SPECIAL USER REQUIREMENTS" section
- As specific examples in relevant sections

## What NOT to Do:
- Don't remove existing instructions
- Don't make prompt significantly longer (max 20% increase)
- Don't create contradictions with existing rules
- Don't use vague language
